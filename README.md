# HT Edit

A native macOS video editor built for Apple silicon. The first feature is **silence detection**: import one or more videos, and every silent stretch is highlighted on the audio waveform right away. You can tune the highlights live, and playback skips the silences.

## Features

- **Import:** ⌘O, the **+** toolbar button, or drag and drop. You can import several files at once; new clips are added to the end.
- **One seamless timeline:** a yellow line marks where each clip starts.
- **Clip sidebar:** shows each clip's thumbnail, name and length. Drag clips to reorder them. Show or hide it with the system sidebar button.
- **Vertical video:** if the video is taller than it is wide, the player sits beside the timeline instead of above it. This is automatic.
- **Live settings:** threshold (dB), padding start and padding end. Highlights update instantly.
- **Playback:** always skips the highlighted silences.

## Speed

- **Parallel decoding:** each file's audio is split into segments that are decoded concurrently, one reader per core.
- **Progressive waveform:** each segment shows its first windows right away, so the waveform fills in from several places at once.
- **Instant playback:** the timeline and playback are ready as soon as the clip's duration has loaded. The video is drawn with a bare `AVPlayerLayer`.
- **Cache:** finished analyses are stored in the app's Caches folder, so re-importing a file is instant.
- **Warm-up at launch:** a splash screen runs the full import path once on a tiny generated clip. This loads the decoder, the reader, the player and the Metal-backed canvas, so the first real import doesn't pay that cost.

## Architecture

| Layer | File(s) |
|---|---|
| Decode + measure | `Audio/AudioLevelAnalyzer.swift`, `Audio/AudioSegmentPlanner.swift`, `Audio/LevelsCache.swift` |
| Detection | `Analysis/SilenceDetector.swift`, `Model/ClipTimeline.swift` |
| Playback | `Playback/CompositionBuilder.swift` (`AVMutableComposition`; `AVVideoComposition.Configuration` for mixed orientations), `Analysis/PlaybackSkipper.swift` |
| Waveform | `Waveform/WaveformSampler.swift`, `Views/WaveformCanvas.swift` (draws only what's visible) |
| UI | `ContentView.swift`, `Views/*`, `App/WarmUp.swift` |

Project settings: Swift 6, MainActor-by-default, macOS 27.

## Building and testing

Open `HT Edit.xcodeproj` in Xcode, then:
- **⌘R** to run the app.
- **⌘U** to run the unit tests (Swift Testing) and UI tests (XCTest).
